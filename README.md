# Pyber_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to analyze ride sharing data across three city types: Urban, Suburban, & Rural, to provide additional insight for future decision making.

## Results from Analysis

After analyzing and reviewing the Pyber Data, the following trends were shown:
* Rural rides have the highest average fare. This is likely due to the distance of the rides required for completing rural rides. Urban rides are typically the cheapest and have the largest amount of available drivers.
* Average fare per driver is highest in rural locations, a result of generally higher fares coupled with a lower number of drivers.

## Summary and Recommendations

### Recommendation 1
Incentivize drivers to perform more rural rides.

### Recommendation 2

### Recommendation 3
