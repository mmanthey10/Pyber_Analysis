# Pyber_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to analyze ride sharing data across three city types: Urban, Suburban, & Rural, to provide additional insight for future decision making.

## Results from Analysis

After analyzing and reviewing the Pyber Data, the following trends were shown:
* Rural rides have the highest average fare, followed by suburban and then urban. This is likely due to higher fares for longer rides. Rural locations likely have higher average distance per ride relative to urbna and suburban rides.
* Total drivers by city type are in the following order: Urban, Suburban, then Rural. This is a product of the population of the different city types and demand for services in those city types.
* Average fare per driver is highest in rural locations, a result of generally higher fares coupled with a lower number of drivers.

## Summary and Recommendations

### Recommendation 1
In an effort to increase revenues in Rural cities, Pyber could incentivize drivers (bonus or increased share of ride fare) to increase the amount of drivers available to perform rural rides.

### Recommendation 2
I would recommend doing further analysis on the impact distance has on fare amounts. Specifically, I would look at the average fare per mile by city type. This would help determine if pricing is consistent across different city types and may provide insight into changing the price structure of rides.

### Recommendation 3
Lastly, I would recommend performing analysis on demand for rides across city types over time. In order to meet the necessary demand for rides, more drivers may be required in certain city types. This would roll into recommendation number one in incentivizing drivers to perform rides in certain city types. If city types are not adequately "staffed" with drivers, there would likely be lost revenues if there are not enough drivers to meet demand.
